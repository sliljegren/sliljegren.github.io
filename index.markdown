My name is Sofie, and I am a researcher in **theoretical and computational astrophysics**, at [Stockholm University](https://www.astro.su.se/english/). My main research interest is in chemistry and molecular formation in supernovae, and modeling ABG stars. Lately, I have been playing around with different machine learning models, to expand on the first principle modeling as well.
