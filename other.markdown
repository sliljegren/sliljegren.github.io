### DOTA2 stats

[Github link]()

I was interested in doing my own data anlysis of stats from the regional DOTA2 leagues. I have two scripts; one to download the match data for a specific league, and one which will import the downloaded json files into pandas for further analysis. I give examples of what can be done with this data as well. 

I have also made a interactive [dashboard]() in Tableau.  -->
